Childcare Need & Supply Analysis (All Counties)
This project analyzes childcare demand and supply across various counties using Python and Excel. It explores trends in accessibility, distribution, and funding types (subsidy vs private pay), providing valuable insights to aid planning and resource allocation.

📊 Project Overview
Objective: Understand childcare availability, identify underserved regions, and support data-driven policy decisions.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy), Excel (for interactive dashboards).

🛠️ Features
County-wise and yearly trend analysis of childcare supply.

Comparison between subsidy and private pay childcare options.

Density analysis relative to population data.

Outlier detection and statistical summaries.

Interactive Excel dashboard for dynamic filtering and visualization.

📂 Dataset
Sourced from Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families.

Fields include: County, SMI Bracket, Age Group, Private_Pay, Subsidy, Unserved_Estimate, etc.

Cleaned and processed using Python for analysis.

📈 Visualizations
Bar and line charts for trend analysis.

Scatter plots for density comparisons.

Pie charts and heatmaps for categorical insights.

Box plots for outlier detection.

📌 Key Insights
Counties with highest unmet childcare demand identified.

Strong correlation between population clusters and service density.

Subsidy programs dominate childcare access in most regions.

🔮 Future Scope
Integrate real-time data via APIs.

Apply ML models to predict future childcare demand.

Analyze budget allocations vs service outcomes.
